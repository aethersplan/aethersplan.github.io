          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>
            Climate change has taken its toll on countless people, no matter
            what part of the world they live in. As technological advances are
            made, we find that urbanization has become an inevitable process,
            and similarly, most people have already been dwelling in urban
            areas. Urban areas are characterized by their distance to nature,
            complexity of infrastructure, and automation of daily tasks. With
            this structure in mind, we can recognize that climate change targets
            those who live in urban areas in a unique way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
            and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) [1], are a great contributor to climate
            change. Because these gases can travel great distances over the
            Earth's atmosphere and impact other regions aside from their origin,
            we conclude that an urban plan that aims to combat climate change
            must consider global action for the best effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            As important as it is to combat climate change, we must also provide
            support for those who are affected by it in the meantime. An urban
            plan should not only work toward reducing the production of harmful
            gases leading to climate change, but it must also propose solutions
            to the struggles it has already inflicted on people and the
            environment. For this objective, it's worth recognizing both the
            causes and effects of climate change as a first step.
          </p>

          <h2>Causes of climate change</h2>
          <p>
            According to the UN website [2], following agents contribute to
            climate change:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Generating power</li>
            <li>Manufacturing goods</li>
            <li>Cutting down forests</li>
            <li>Using transportation</li>
            <li>Producing food</li>
            <li>Powering buildings</li>
            <li>Consuming too much</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Effects of climate change</h2>
          <p>
            According to the UN website [2], climate change results in the
            following scenarios:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Hotter temperatures</li>
            <li>More severe storms</li>
            <li>Increased drought</li>
            <li>A warming, rising ocean</li>
            <li>Loss of species</li>
            <li>Not enough food</li>
            <li>More health risks</li>
            <li>Poverty and displacement</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Having touched on some key facts about climate change, we are ready
            to present our blueprint for more sustainable cities with localized,
            generalized, and additional cues.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="dark-pink" style="padding: 4em 0">
          <h1>The Urban Plan</h1>
          <h2>Localized suggestions</h2>
          <p>
            An urban plan should take into account the current structure of
            human settlements, which it will provide improvements to. We address
            the cities Beijing, China and Kolkata, India to draw inspiration for
            how an ideal, sustainable city should be structured. The legend
            below gives some necessary information to understand the following
            graphics.
          </p>

          <img
            src="images/content/image1.png"
            alt="A map legend providing necessary information to understand the following graphics"
          />

          <h3>1. Beijing, China</h3>

          <img
            src="images/content/image2.png"
            alt="An image exhibiting the settlement characteristics of Beijing, China"
          />

          <p>
            Based on this settlement data of Beijing, China, we can spot a
            striking abundance of residential areas and the scarce distribution
            of green areas between those. As buildings tend to utilize fossil
            fuels, like natural gas, to maintain comfortable warmth, those green
            areas can compensate for carbon dioxide emissions to an extent.
            Adopting this observed pattern, our urban plan recommends planting
            trees between buildings and roadsides in crowded areas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, we realize that green areas are still somewhat
            isolated, sometimes uneven, and insufficient. Ranked by priority,
            our urban plan includes the following goals:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              City leaders should invest in planting trees in open spaces with
              low vegetation (gray), compensating for the carbon dioxide
              emissions. For the parts surrounded by water (blue), agricultural
              practices should be prioritized to sustain economic growth, as
              water is expected to accelerate agricultural benefits. To minimize
              future flooding incidents and risking people's shelters,
              settlements shouldn't be built near water resources.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-residential areas (pink, purple) should be deconstructed, and
              new housing areas should be built in their place. During the
              deconstruction, the waste should be recycled instead of outright
              dumped. For the reconstruction, recycled materials should be
              preferred. This way, a sustainable loop of recycling materials can
              be established.
            </li>
            <li>
              In relation to some settlements located close to water resources,
              we recommend building small healthcare departments that deal with
              emergencies on potential flooding incidents. If possible, we
              recommend the excavation of open areas with low vegetation near
              these water resources to expand the space water fills in. The soil
              in those areas should be replaced and reused for agricultural
              activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              In some settlements surrounded by a great volume of trees
              (expected to be light green), emergency services to address
              potential wildfires should be employed. We recommend creating
              communicative services, which residents can report wildfires to,
              and building local and small departments of firefighters with
              sufficient equipment to minimize potential damage.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>2. Kolkata, India</h3>

          <img
            src="images/content/image3.png"
            alt="An image exhibiting the settlement characteristics of Kolkata, India"
          />
          <p>
            In Kolkata, India, we can see a long-flowing river in the middle of
            the city, which settlements directly accompany. We see that this
            poses an increased risk of flooding. In addition, there's an
            abundance of open areas with low vegetation. Ranked by priority, our
            urban plan includes the following goals:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              City leaders should build emergency departments that can provide
              immediate support for victims of potential flooding incidents.
              Furthermore, paths for the water to flow, especially leading to
              open areas, should be excavated to minimize the risk of flooding
              in the future and aid in plant growth and economic development.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because the river seems to disrupt the flow of transportation
              routes leading to longer durations of travel and lower preference
              of public transport, we recommend building more bridges that
              enable passage over the river. This way, transportation in the
              city is facilitated, and less emissions are made to navigate
              around.
            </li>
            <li>
              We know that renewable energy organizations are a great
              replacement of fossil fuels. The river stands out as a great
              opportunity to utilize hydropower facilities, serve the rest of
              the city, and even power this urban plan practically.
            </li>
            <li>
              Considering open areas with high vegetation (light green) are
              distributed somewhat regularly, we suggest prioritizing
              agricultural initiatives on open areas with low vegetation (gray).
              To compensate for the high density of buildings in the center, the
              gray areas are a better option to continue urbanization.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Generalized and additional suggestions</h2>
          <h3>1. Health risks owing to air pollution</h3>
          <p>
            NASA Earth Observatory Data suggests that nitrogen dioxide in the
            air is attributable to cases of pediatric asthma and turns the
            spotlight on urban areas. Accordingly, children tend to be the most
            susceptible to respiratory diseases, and air pollution is universal
            and carries deadly risks. Our urban plan includes the following
            goal:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              More, small, and decentralized hospitals that are concentrated
              among the city, focusing on respiratory diseases and prioritizing
              children, should be established. This way, we encourage parents to
              seek help for their children's health conditions that seem trivial
              and reduce potential emissions made while traveling to bigger
              hospitals, including nitrogen dioxide, by promoting shorter
              distances.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>2. Landfills (city dumps)</h3>

          <p>
            In some cities, the garbage materials lead to specific areas
            destined for storage. Sometimes, it's the governments that choose to
            store such waste in areas disparate from cities. Despite not
            affecting urban lives, they are harmful for ecosystems and cause air
            and underground-water pollution. We urge that waste-disposal
            facilities be used in these cities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Waste-disposal facilities can produce electricity and heat from the
            methane originating from landfills and natural fertilizers from
            household waste. Furthermore, they can exploit bacteria in spaces
            without oxygen to destroy organic waste.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sweden presents a great alternative storage model. Their
            "waste-to-energy" plan burns 2 million tons of the country's waste
            in incinerators, recycling 99% of Sweden's waste. The gravity of
            this situation is also evident in the garbage coming in from Norway
            at a hefty price. Norway, selling its waste to Sweden for a fee,
            takes back the resulting metal ash from Sweden, as incineration
            would be more costly within its own borders. Our urban plan includes
            the following goals:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Do not store the city's garbage, but rather create sustainable
              facilities, such as waste disposal facilities, solid waste
              transfer stations, recycling facilities that citizens can directly
              use, composting facilities, and medical waste disposal facilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use waste-derived fuel: the conversion from non-recyclable waste,
              which comes from municipal, industrial, and commercial sources,
              into fuel for energy purposes by processing them through physical,
              chemical and mechanical processes.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>3. Access to public resources</h3>

          <p>
            The residents' well-being is critical in sustainable cities. We
            believe that this necessitates guaranteed access to quality
            education, safe health centres, easy-to-access public
            transportation, garbage collection services, and good air quality,
            among other modern life demands.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the populations and challenges of cities evolve, so does the
            necessity of adaptive solutions. For example, New York City's
            post-Sandy action plan consists of 250 ambitious initiatives of
            infrastructure resilience, related to transportation,
            telecommunications, parks, insurance, and building structure. Our
            urban plan includes the following goals:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Health systems aim for protection with equal focus on treatment.
              Doctors should take care of sicknesses before they appear, and not
              just after. To apply this, systems should not sectorize the
              vaccine cycle. Therefore, protector methods must be delivered by
              states to the people living in complex or outer-city areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              To provide equity in education, we believe that schools should not
              be customized to a specific group of people. Plus, higher
              education should not request money in any case. For people living
              in complex or outer-city areas, institutions that provide
              education up to the compulsory education level and that provide
              education in general culture for people beyond school age should
              be established. Teachers who have just graduated can work at these
              institutions to gain experience and reduce unemployment. "Village
              Institutions" in Turkiye, which were implemented between 1940 and
              1954, are good examples for such an approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cultural activity centers that provide free cultural and daily
              courses should be set up.
            </li>
            <li>
              City leaders can build free or cheap individual transportation
              systems (such as bicycles and electronic scooters) that can be
              controlled via an application. A taxi-like system can be built for
              people with special needs.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>4. Urban renewal actions</h3>

          <p>
            Another fundamental characteristic of sustainable cities is the
            renovation of public spaces. Public streets, squares, parks, urban
            spaces, as well as modern irrigation and waste management practices,
            help preserve the cultural heritage of a city through renovation and
            restoration. Ideally, urban renewal in a city is done in a
            completely integrated way. For example, in Melbourne, there are
            rebates designed to incentivize property owners to adopt sustainable
            practices resulting in the efficient use of energy and water while
            reducing their waste to a minimum.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Recognizing climate justice</h3>
          <p>
            While our urban plan has proposed as many principles as possible,
            these demands are the most applicable by only small groups of people
            who control cities, corporations, and governments. In addition, we
            realize that neither everyone is equally responsible for climate
            change nor everyone is equally facing its risks.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to Our World in Data, the countries China, the United
            States, India, Russia, and Brazil appear to be pioneers in
            greenhouse emissions. We demand that governments and corporations of
            these countries should take the lead in combating climate change and
            helping those affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any region, the rich possess the most resources to respond to and
            recover from disasters driven by climate change and often make the
            greatest contribution (e.g. by deploying private jets). Women,
            people of color, marginalized communities, and lower classes are
            faced with the additional burden of housing, employment, and
            financial recovery, and they experience the greatest losses. Our
            urban plan necessitates the confrontation of the most privileged
            people to take accountability and prioritize the health, safety, and
            satisfaction of the most damaged groups of people.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>
            This marks the end of our urban plan. We have touched on the causes
            and effects of climate change, our proposed improvements both
            pertaining to specific locations and applicable in general contexts,
            and additional demands to maximize the happiness of people and the
            health of the environment. We realize that our plan is not perfect
            at any cost, but we hope it will provide people with a greater
            awareness of climate change and inspire concrete action toward a
            more desirable future.
